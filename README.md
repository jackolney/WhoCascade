# WHO Cascade Model

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jackolney/WhoCascade.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jackolney/WhoCascade)

This is a deterministic version of the ["Care Cascade"](https://github.com/jackolney/CareCascade) model, but heavily simplified for uses that will become apparent over time...

## To Do List:

1. Wrap `CascadeDashboard` (the shiny app) in a package.
2. Unit tests on the package (`testthat`)
3. Point TravisCI at _both_ `cascade` and `CascadeDashboard` directories and build them. Can we do that with Travis or should I just farm out to another repo? (this was perhaps poor planning on my part)
